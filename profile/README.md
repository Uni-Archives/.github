Uni-Archives is an innovative academic platform designed to enhance collaboration and knowledge-sharing among university students and educators. It allows users to securely upload, share, and access academic materials, including lecture slides, notes, exams, and quizzes.

The platform provides two content-sharing models:

- **Free Access:** Users can share materials for free with optional ad-supported revenue.

- **Paid Access:** Users can sell their academic content securely via an integrated payment system.

Additional features include AI-powered assistance, Optical Character Recognition (OCR) for text extraction, a leaderboard for content relevance, and multilingual support (Arabic and English).

## üìà Motivation

The project was born out of the need to provide students with reliable, easily accessible educational resources.

Uni-Archives bridges these gaps by offering:

- A structured, university-specific content-sharing system.

- AI-powered search and recommendations.

- Monetization options for contributors.
